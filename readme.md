## About

TraShip is a game where the player uses a ship to collect trash in the ocean. The player should collect as much trash as possible in a given time. If the time is finished, then the game ends. In the ocean, there are objects other than trash, such as rocks and fishes. The ocean will appear clearer as the trash decreases.

The merit of this game is to entertain the player through a unique gameplay and features while also aiming to raise awareness about managing our trash better, so that it will not pollute our environment.

We plan to add more features, such as day/night cycle, variation of ships, and sea mines after the base game is finished.
